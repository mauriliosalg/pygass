[VIVM](http://github.com/paulomarcondes/vivm)

VIVM is a Vagrant based Virtual Machine tailored for scientific computing with Python/Ipython. Vagrant depends on VirtualBox. The guest OS is Ubuntu 12.04LTS.

Since you are running a VM, you could whatever you want, but it already has all ipython dependencies and git installed.

Please allocate a sensible ammount of time, because there is a big download upfront.
